# NEET Girl Date Night

neet girl date night is a visual novel made by Hitsuji on the itch.io website. the story goes that your friend sets you up with his cousin kara and you go on a date with her. you find out during the date that she is a neet that's chronically online and stays in her room all day. a chunk of the interactions with her is like talking to sombody that spends way to much time on the internet on message borads and twitter. once she opens up to you and you get to know her she seems like an ok person. overall the game is decent but nothing to write home about.

## 6/10 - it's ok
