# ann

ann is a game made avable on the itch.io website and steam. in the game you play a girl named ann that breaks the schools rule of staying there after 9:00pm due to falling alseep in the computer room. she wakes up to find herself trapped in the school and there is scary paranormal stuff going on. the game plays like a cheezy freeware rpg maker game but in a good way. overall the game is ok for killing some time on you computer.

## 6/10- it's ok
