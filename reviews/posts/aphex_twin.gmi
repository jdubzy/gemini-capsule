# aphex twin: Selected Ambient Works 85-92

this ablum is a pretty decent electronic ablum. it has a wide range between techno/electronic to industiral sounds all throughout. also, it's very relaxing to listen to and the beats have a very hypnotising feel to them. the ablum is good background noise while surfing the web and doing other things. if you haven't already you should really check this ablum out if you like electronic/techno music with some industial sound.

## 8/10 - it's pretty decent
